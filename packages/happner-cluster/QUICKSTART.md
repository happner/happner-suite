## Quickstart

### Motivation

Hapnper-cluster provides clustering capabilities for happner, so that multiple happner cluster nodes will have access to the same components via RPC, as well as the underlying shared happn data structures and events bus.

### Installation

In your project's root directory, run

```bash
npm i happner-cluster
```
